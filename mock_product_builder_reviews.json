I look forward to seeing other options and upgrades avail. for this app. However for someone who isn't very good with computers this app was easy for me to use. I was able to ask questions and get help from the support team very quickly. They seem to be pleasant and genuine with wanting to help me succeed.  Customer service is on the decline and its always good to find people that still enjoy helping others. I love this app and I hope it grows my business further. ",

To better prepare, and to ensure honesty, we even asked Bold if our devs would easily be able to change the design according to our own, and they said an absolute 'yes'. So we paid $$$ to have the design made, and it's been over a year and we are yet to find a dev that can do this for us. Our dev is AMAZING and can do anything...he's been with us for over 10 years as he is a wiz, and even he can't do as our design requires.\r\n\r\nCurrently searching for a new app.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Honestly, YOU (bold) could do better.\r\n\r\nFirst let's start with the most important part of this review. Most of the good reviews of this app seem to be fake. How I recognize that is by going to all of the stores that all these positive reviews lead too. 90% of them don't use this apps services, so its hard to believe they just think its cool to pay you guys to not use your poor services. DON'T use this app unless your whole entire business strategy depends on it.\r\n\r\n Visually, this app looks absolutely terrible. Besides the lack of support, difficult settings, and poor design of software, the page that the app produces on your store is hideous! Like, we are talking craigslist style. Don't waste your time or money on this app. \r\n\r\nSecond I want to tell you about how difficult programming this app is. Notice I said \"programming\", because that is exactly what you have to do to get the app to work. To make this app work for your store, you literally have to write code like sets of rules. Which by the way is explained no where in the tutorial sections of this app. Also to let it even go live on your store you actually do have to mess with the code of your store. So just to be able to understand how to use this app, and/or install it, you're going to need some knowledge in computer programming.\r\n\r\nThirdly let me go over what I mean by hideous. After 4 hours teasing my brain trying to figure out the mechanics of this app, I found out that the page it actually produces (build a product page) is visually awful! They give you very little options of changing the layout of the page, but even the options you do have don't do much. It is next to impossible to be able to match this 'build a product' page to your actual store. The design of the page literally looks like you are on craigslist. Absolutely no modern influence seemed to have gone into the visual designing of this software.\r\n\r\nMy honest opinion of the app is that, BOLD OWES ME MONEY. Just like the rest of you shoppifiers, my time is valuable. Sadly, I put a lot of time into trying to get this to work only to find out it is a COMPLETE RIP OFF of time and money at the rate they charge.\r\n\r\nSeriously, they should be paying us to use it just to fix all of their problems. The developers of this app seem like the type of people that I hate through what they have produced. Money hungry let downs that don't understand the importance of quality work. If they did, they wouldn't be charging $60 dollars a month for me to have a headache and waste advertising money on a page that looks worse than Trumps hair cut.\r\n\r\nCome on guys, again YOU CAN DO BETTER.",

        "body": "Was excited to find this app, essentially it's exactly what I need. Unfortunately after you add all your products and options in the last step you have to click a button to \"generate image scenarios\" to assign an individual image for each scenario. Makes sense, but if you ever change or add an option that affects the assigned images, you have to click that button again to REgenerate the new scenarios and it erases ALL of your past uploads. If you never intend on adding products after your intial upload to the app, it would be fine. BOLD something to think about improving possibly?\r\n\r\nThe back end was a bit clunky and hard to make changes (font, frame size, photo size) for a non programmer. I mean I'm on shopify because I'm not a programmer right?\r\n\r\nI paid to have the app installed because again, I'm not a programmer. The customer service was a bit lacking pending the installation of the app but the follow up after my review shows BOLD does indeed care about their brand and has potential to provide adequate customer support.

Anyone who knows anything about e commerce knows that 78% of customers are now using mobile devices or tablets to shop and checkout on online stores. What are we in 1997 thinking people are on desk tops, The numbers don't lie. This could be such a huge tool for us and despite trying to figure it out on our own and a few phone calls with the company we are still no closer to getting any resolution. We then asked them well how would we get this to fit and be optimized for mobile format and came back with a price of $6,000 dollars! To which my question is WHY NOT just have your people optimize it on your own dime being it will help ALL of your customers being again there is such a huge number of people using mobile devices to shop in our current time. 100% discouraged and dissatisfied.

I offer custom framing and to purchase custom picture framing software is very hard to find and when you do it's beyond expensive! I needed the ability to have a client pick a frame and then matting selection and then any options and show the client a preview image of any combination they would be selecting. The Product Builder app does it and it does it with ease! I will not lie, it will take a good while to initially set everything up because you could be dealing with thousands of image, but it's totally worth the time that you put it! One of the biggest concerns I had going in was support. I know that I would be needing support with issues and questions that I would have. It's been three weeks now since I started using the app and I have reached out to support many times, and was pleasantly surprised! Between chat and emails, my questions where answered very quickly usually within 24 hours, if not sooner. The also offer phone support, which is a rare thing now a day! I would highly recommend this app! They offer a free 30 day trail, so take the time to download and give it a go!",

I opted to have the Bold team do the Shopify theme integration (which was very inexpensive) they added the Builder very quickly and immediately were available to see if I had any questions as I got started using it.  I signed up for a webinar and Dex was my dev rep.  He was super helpful and answered all my questions while giving me some tips along the way, like the Hidden Products fields!  I really appreciate companies like Bold that care about their new customer's and their initial experience.  I think the Product Builder will be a key component to my store's success.  \r\n\r\np.s. One plea - if there's anyway to add an overlay feature to the preview image in the app I think that would be icing on the cake.

No bulk upload either.)\r\n\r\nBIGGEST GRIPE: This product has a deal-breaker piece of functionality. When you add products and product options - you have to click a button to \"generate image scenarios\" so that you can upload an individual image for each scenario. This is all well and good, but now let's say you ever change or add an option. You have to click that button again to generate the new scenarios. Guess what. IT ERASES EVERY IMAGE YOU'VE EVER UPLOADED. So if you, like me, had thousands of images saved to various scenarios (product + artwork + color, etc) - then you have to go through and upload EACH IMAGE AGAIN, one at a time (6 clicks to upload each image). This user experience alone should stop you from wasting $60/month on this product.\r\n\r\nIf you build your Product Builder and never want to ever change it again, than this product may just work for you.",

Having raised these issues my tickets were closed without resolution and merged into another ticket. Despite multiple attempts for a response that ticket is still open two months later and I have received no update. \r\n\r\nBugs happen, thats understandable, however high impact issues in this case have not been worked on and have been left as known issues with no updates as to when they will be resolved.\r\n\r\nMy main issue is that when updating products set within my builders they frequently do not save and they automatically duplicate the product description text, often 100 times! Also be aware that when updating product pricing in Shopify this does not flow into the products setup within the builder - this must be done manually (to show the correct price within the builder). This bug means that a manual update that should take a few hours (e.g. to update prices) can take days, literally. It is becoming unworkable and there has been no sign of a solution from Bold to date.\r\n\r\nSo be aware, if you have more than 100 products in your store, this app could become a real issue for your business until these bugs are actually addressed by Bold.\r\n\r\nIf these were fixed, I'd highly recommend it. As it stands, it comes with a few health warnings attached! Others seem to have had great support from Bold but in this case we have been let down so far - I hope I can update this review with more positive news at some point soon.",

We wanted a way to let surfers specify their boards in an easy to use and fun way - there was nothing else that comes close to the flexibility Product Builder provides. Our only reservation was the lack of ability to duplicate builders which we raised with Bold and well thats been added as a feature now. So we're super stoked with that. It works reliably, is quick and the integration with the cart is excellent. We've pushed to edges of this to get what we want and it works real well. Thoroughly recommend this App.\r\n\r\nPlus the customer service is totally excellent - the guys at Bold just get the job done quickly and are courtious and helpful - but more importantly - actually do stuff quickly. Its obvious they know what its like to run a small business.\r\n\r\nWe like this App at Endeavour Surf.\r\n\r\nBryan",

I am currently traveling and the service is pretty pathetic as there is no easy way to contact them except to work during US hours as the email responses are delayed by 2-3 days. They also ask people to write positive reviews so that they can extend the free services for apps. I would always go for a free bee as I am a small business owner and I need all the savings I can get. The positive reviews are generated by many people who wanted savings and I am not sure how relevant they are as far as the functionality and service of the app is concerned.",
